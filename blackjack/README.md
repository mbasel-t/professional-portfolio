# Blackjack
This was a group capstone project I worked on in COMP170 "Object-Oriented Programming", which I took in Spring 2024. It is a simple implementation of the Blackjack card game in the console log, demonstrating proficiency with fundamentals of the Java coding language.

Because I worked in a group, not every method was built by me. Methods which I did not work on are marked accordingly as "other's work".

## BlackJack.java
BlackJack.java is the primary file for the game. By running this file, the game is executed.

### Method main

### Method slowDown (others' work)
This method has no argument or return. It simply pauses console log output for 1.2 seconds, so that the game text is more readable.

### Method printRules (others' work)
This method has no argument or return. It simply outputs the rules of BlackJack into the console.

### Method bet
This method takes two arguments, "players" (Player[]) and "input" (Scanner).

### Method firstRound
This method takes 

### Method round

### Method checkPlay

### Method checkPlayable

### Method checkBust

### Method endRound

### Method checkPlayerWin

### Method checkToContinue

### Method dealCard (others' work)

### Method endSession
This method takes one argument, players (Player[]), and does not return. endSession is called at the end of a play session. It iterates through all players, and announces their balance at the end of the game if they have any left. If the player balance is empty, then it announces that that player is "bankrupt".
